     * TECH TIP: State Machines
     * We use a "state machine" to control our launcher motor and feeder servos in this program.
     * The first step of a state machine is creating an enum that captures the different "states"
     * that our code can be in.
     * The core advantage of a state machine is that it allows us to continue to loop through all
     * of our code while only running specific code when it's necessary. We can continuously check
     * what "State" our machine is in, run the associated code, and when we are done with that step
     * move on to the next state.
     * This enum is called the "LaunchState". It reflects the current condition of the shooter
     * motor and we move through the enum when the user asks our code to fire a shot.
     * It starts at idle, when the user requests a launch, we enter SPIN_UP where we get the
     * motor up to speed, once it meets a minimum speed then it starts and then ends the launch process.
     * We can use higher level code to cycle through these states. But this allows us to write
     * functions and autonomous routines in a way that avoids loops within loops, and "waits".
